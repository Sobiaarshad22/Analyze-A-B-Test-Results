# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
In this Repository I included files for statistical data analysis for a project.
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

For this project,I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My primary goal in this project was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
